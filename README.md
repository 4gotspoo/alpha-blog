This repository exists as a showcase of the "alpha-blog" application for the Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course for Udemy.

This web application utilizes **Rails 2.5.3** and possesses the following features:
- User accounts: create, read, and update actions
- User authentication using the 'bcrypt' gem
- Administrative level accounts and action restrictions
- Post/Article create, read, update, and delete actions
- Post indexing and pagination
- Category selection and mulit-multi association with posts

The CSS uses the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) boilerplate.
